# Foodversity
CS 3041 Extra Credit Assignment

Hello everyone! 

My application is called "Foodversity". The main idea behind this application for users to be able to complete a simple quiz to determine healthy alternatives to typical, late night college meals. The intended users are college students and, even young professionals, of all genders, ethnicities, and lifestyles. However, this application is mainly catered to those who are busy and a low-budget. 

This application was created using a user-trial of the proto.io prototyping website. I've exported the project to HTML and uploaded it to github. The easiest way to preview this website is using this link: https://pr.to/BVEXRR/

Once you clink on the link, you will then be able to preview this protoype. You will then be able take a user quiz to determine the best meal option for you. As of a right now, the application does not save any user data and will only provide one preloaded result. Other features include the ability to re-take the quiz and saving a recipe for later viewing. 

Thank you, 
Alexandria
